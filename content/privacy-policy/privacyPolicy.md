<p>This Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Storj Labs Inc. and its affiliate, Storj Labs International SEZC (together referred to as “<b>Storj</b>” “<b>we</b>,” “<b>us</b>,” or “<b>our</b>”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy (the “<b>Sites</b>”), Storj’s online storage services and applications, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”). The Services enable users to store data on third-party devices that have installed an open source, distributed storage software (“<b>Software</b>”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information other devices that have installed the Software may collect about you or your device in connection with your use of the Software. For details about the information these other devices may collect about you or your device, please see this <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://storj.io/storj-share-information/">help page</a>.</p>

<p>Storj is a platform and service provider that provides decentralized cloud storage by connecting those seeking to store data (“<b>Users”) with those providing space for cloud storage (“<b>Storage Node Operators</b>”) (the “<b>Storage Services”).  </p>

<p>Data submitted by Users to the Services for storage with Storage Node Operators (“<b>Storage Materials</b>”) is encrypted, which prevents Storj and Storage Node Operators from accessing the content of the Storage Materials. Storj acts as a service provider/processor of Storage Materials on behalf of its Users. Individuals whose data may be included in Storage Materials ultimately are subject to the privacy policies and practices of the User utilizing Storj for Storage Services. Accordingly, for the purposes of the European Union (“<b>EU</b>”) General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR</b>”), Users act as the data controller with respect to the processing of the Storage Materials. Storj is not responsible for the privacy practices of Users. Storj acts as the data controller and not a processor/service provider when, for example, Users, Storage Node Operators, and other Site visitors provide Storj with information, such as contact, account, and registration information.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. By using the Services, you expressly and voluntarily are accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (and other applicable agreements, such as the Tardigrade Terms of Service, and Storage Node Operator Terms and Conditions) (collectively, “<b>Agreements</b>”) that allow us to process information about you.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy contains the following sections:</p>

		<u>Notice About Use of our Public Forums and Features</u>

		<p>Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with others, such as through our public forums, blogs and message boards. You should be aware that any information you provide or post in these ways may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.  We encourage you to be cautious about the information you submit (e.g., choose a username that does not disclose your personal identity).  Whenever you post something publicly, it may be impossible to remove all instances of the posted information, for example, if someone has taken a screenshot of your posting.</p>

		<u>Social Sharing Features</u>

		<p>Our Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your contacts or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.

		<p><b>Cookies and Online Analytics</b></p>

		<p>We use a variety of online tracking and analytics tools (e.g., cookies, pixel tags, and HTML5) to collect and analyze information as you use the Services. Among other things, these technologies allow us to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing and usage preferences. </p>

		<p>We may also use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics, Coremetrics, Mixpanel, and Segment) on our Services to collect and analyze information collected through these technologies to assist us in auditing, research, or reporting; fraud prevention; and, providing certain features to you.  The types of tracking and analytics tools we and our service providers use for these purposes are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>“Cookies” are small data files stored on your computer or device to collect information about your use of the Services. Cookies may enable us to recognize you as the same user who used our Services in the past, and relate your use of the Services to other information we have about you. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Services (for example, by storing your username) and/or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, limit your use of our Services or features. To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/" class="link">here</a>.  Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services. </li>

			<li>“Local shared objects,” or “flash cookies,” may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software. Local shared objects operate much like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings. For information on managing flash cookies, for example, click <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118">here</a>.</li>

			<li>A “pixel tag” (also known as a “<b>clear GIF</b>” or “<b>web beacon</b>”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our web pages.</li>

			<p>
			<b>Do Not Track</b>. Do Not Track (“<b>DNT</b>”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for online advertising and analytics purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about Do Not Track.

In general, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
