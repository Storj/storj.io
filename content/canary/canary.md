Storj Labs Inc. Warrant Canary

Existing and proposed laws, especially as relate to the US Patriot Act, etc., provide for secret warrants,
searches and seizures of data, such as library records.

Some such laws provide for criminal penalties for revealing the warrant, search or seizure, disallowing the
disclosure of events that would materially affect the users of a service such as Storj Labs Inc.

Storj Labs Inc. and its principals and employees will in fact comply with such warrants and their provisions
for secrecy.

Storj Labs Inc. will also make available, monthly, a "warrant canary" in the form of a cryptographically signed
message containing the following:

- a declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have been served, nor have any searches or seizures
  taken place

- a cut and paste headline from a major news source, establishing date

Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page.

The current message is here:
