      <description>Using the Storj Share software makes your computer part of a distributed network. This means your computer may communicate with many other computers. This works just like any other communication on the internet, like when you connect to Facebook or Google. As part of this process, those other nodes can store some information about your computer and your interactions.
None of this information is dangerous to share with the network. Your computer shares a lot of it every day when you browse the web.</description>
