      <description>Storj Labs Inc. Warrant Canary
Existing and proposed laws, especially as relate to the US Patriot Act, etc., provide for secret warrants, searches and seizures of data, such as library records.
Some such laws provide for criminal penalties for revealing the warrant, search or seizure, disallowing the disclosure of events that would materially affect the users of a service such as Storj Labs Inc.
Storj Labs Inc. and its principals and employees will in fact comply with such warrants and their provisions for secrecy.</description>
